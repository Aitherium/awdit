> **The Aither World** is an operating system for agents — a Linux you can hand to one, the runtimes it works in, and the tools it works with. [awnix](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the Linux underneath it; **awdit** is one of its 33 bricks — each installs on its own, runs offline, and needs no account.

An append-only audit trail whose **gaps are detectable**.

```bash
pip install awdit
```

```python
from awdit import append, verify

append("audit.log", "deploy", service="veil", by="david")

r = verify("audit.log")
if not r:
    for problem in r.problems:
        print(problem)
```

```bash
awdit append audit.log deploy --field service=veil
awdit verify audit.log        # 0 verified · 1 a real problem · 2 could not judge
awdit tail   audit.log -n 20
```

## What it actually proves

Records are hash-chained: each one binds the digest of the one before it, so
**altering** or **reordering** history breaks the chain at the point of the edit
and `verify` names the record. That much is ordinary.

The part usually got wrong is **truncation**. A hash chain proves the records
you are holding follow one another. It says nothing about records that used to
be on the end and are not there now — and cutting the tail off a chained log
leaves a perfectly valid shorter chain. That is exactly the edit someone who has
just done something wants to make, and exactly the one a naive "tamper-evident
log" permits in silence.

So the **anchor** is part of the format, not an add-on. `append()` maintains a
sidecar holding the head digest and the record count, and `verify` compares
against it:

```
TRUNCATED: anchor records 3 entries, log holds 2 — 1 removed from the end
```

Three failures, reported as three different things, because during an incident
they call for different responses:

| verdict | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ALTERED` | a record's content no longer matches its own hash |
| `REORDERED` | a record's `prev` does not match the previous record's hash |
| `TRUNCATED` | the chain is internally perfect but shorter than the anchor |

## What it does not prove — stated, not papered over

**If the anchor is on the same disk as the log, an attacker with write access
edits both.** The anchor turns truncation from *undetectable* into *detectable
by anyone who has a copy of the head*. To get a real guarantee, put the head
somewhere the writer cannot reach: another host, a signed artifact
([`awseal`](https://github.com/Aitherium/awseal)), a transparency log, a
sentence in a chat channel.

A security property whose limits nobody can state is not one you can rely on,
so: **this detects tampering, it does not prevent it**, and its truncation
detection is exactly as strong as the independence of the anchor.

`verify` also reports `NO ANCHOR` as a **warning that is not a pass** — a chain
with no anchor is self-consistent and truncatable, and reporting "ok" there
would convert a missing record into a positive assurance.

## Design notes

- **No dependencies.** An audit log that needs an install before it can be read
  is one nobody reads during an incident; `hashlib` and `json` are the whole
  requirement.
- **The record lands before the anchor moves.** If the process dies between the
  two, verification reports an anchor *behind* the log — recoverable and
  obvious. The other order loses a record while claiming completeness.
- **Digests are taken over canonical JSON** (sorted keys, no whitespace), so a
  log rewritten by a different writer does not read as tampered. An alarm that
  fires on formatting is an alarm nobody keeps.
- **An unparseable line is reported as itself**, not skipped — a silently
  dropped line becomes a chain gap blamed on the *next* record.

## Tests

Every claim has a mutation that breaks it, including one asserting that a
truncated chain with the anchor removed verifies **clean** — the proof that the
anchor is load-bearing rather than decoration.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest
```

## The aw family

Standalone tools that share one idea: **replace something you would otherwise have to _trust_ with something you can _check_.**

Each installs on its own, works offline, and needs no account.

| [AitherConnect](https://github.com/Aitherium/AitherConnect) | what a page tells your browser to do | a federated search and desktop bridge you host |
| [awreason](https://github.com/Aitherium/awreason) | a confident paragraph | the phases it went through, and every tool call it made to get there |
| [awrecurse](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrecurse) | that everything you pasted in was actually read | which slices it opened, and what it concluded from each |
| [awprism](https://github.com/Aitherium/awprism) | the first explanation that fits | the ranked alternatives, and the observation that separates them |
| [awrepl](https://github.com/Aitherium/awrepl) | what the agent believes the value is | the value, printed from the live session |
| [awresearch](https://github.com/Aitherium/awresearch) | a summary of pages nobody opened | every claim against the source it came from |
| [awpredict](https://github.com/Aitherium/awpredict) | a model because it trained without erroring | its prediction against a self-updating lookup, on the rows that are actually novel |
| [awkno](https://github.com/Aitherium/awkno) | that the docs site is up, or that you remember the family | the whole ecosystem in your terminal, with no network at all |

[**awnix**](https://github.com/Aitherium/awnix) is the ground floor — A Linux you can hand to an agent — immutable base, capabilities included.
